### Serenity Jasmine Runner Examples
This is the companion repo to my blog post introduced the Serenity Jasmine runner for .NET. This repo makes heavy usage of Fubu's ripple infrastructure and rake. 

To get started, simply clone the repo locally and run "rake".

### How do I see the tests run?

> rake open_jasmine

### Does this work on Mono?
Not yet...would you like to help? ;)
